# All About Flexbox Presentation
--------------------------------
This is the source code for the presentation I gave at the Utah Angular Meetup in Lehi on October 11. I invite you to experiment with the css, and learn all you can about flexbox. I intentionally avoided tools such as less and kept my css in a single file to keep it simple, and show what's easily possible with flexbox and the power of css...and what's not.

I used [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) and [prism](http://prismjs.com/) for slides and highlighting respectively.

Thanks go to @ChanningAllen for his [tower defense game](http://www.flexboxdefense.com/) and Chris Coyier for his [amazing guide to flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) which I referenced heavily for this presentation.
